      credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It uniquely identifies a\n *          device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the lifetime of an\n *          application.</p>\n *          <p>Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or\n *          more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon\n *          Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app.\n *          Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider\n *          trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS\n *          credentials.</p>\n *          <p>For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide\n *
